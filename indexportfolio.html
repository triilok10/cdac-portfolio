            “One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.”
            <p id="portfolioPlus-2">In this Blog, I will used to share my thoughts that what things motivated me to
                Learn Web Developement. Before three years back, at the time of Covid in July 2020, I used to prepare
                for JEE-MAINS exam. Due to large effect of COVID, My parents was not agree to join the Foundation for
                the preparatation of JEE-MAINS. Playing with computer and keyboard is one of the things which I like to
                spent my time during Covid.</p>

        <h2>How does our inner connection help us in our difficult times?</h2>
        <h3>Everyone face difficult times in their life. People who have a strong inner connection can make it through without breaking apart.</h3>
        <h3>Have a inner connection means that you are closer to the Highest Power. This closeness brings us a sense of Trust, Security and Strength. Even through we may face difficult times, we do belive in everything we fall into place in the end. This hole lights up our path, and we are not afraid to walk anymore.</h3>
        <h3>To create inner connection, we need genuine to be our thoughts, kind in our action, and have a compassionate heart. Praying and Meditating can enhance this internal connection, as do being grateful what we have.</h3>
